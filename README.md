# Hackademy Node Starter Project

Welcome to Hackademy!

This repository will be the starting place for your work through Hackademy. Following the instructions below will get you set up and ready to start working. Many items may seem new at first, but as you progress through Hackademy, everything should become more familiar. We encourage you to make this codebase your own!

## Running

Running your project for development is a single command:

```bash
npm run gulp
```

This will run [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), starting your Node server, wrapping it in a proxy server that will be accessible on multiple devices and live reload your assets, and watch your Node file for changes, stopping and starting the Node server on changes. It will also lint all of your JavaScript and Sass, compile your Sass, Uglify your JavaScript, and optimize your Images (yay Task Runners!).

## Testing and Deploying to Bluemix

Testing and deploying to Bluemix is all done through Travis, which you should already have set up. Whenever a commit comes in to any branch of your repository, Travis will start up and run `npm gulp test`. If it finds any errors, it'll be angry :rage: and you'll need to go fix them. Once all of your tests pass, Travis will be happy again :green_heart:. If you want to add tests to run, add some Gulp tasks and make sure they're run during the `test` Gulp task.

If a commit comes in to the `master` branch and all of the tests pass, Travis will use CloudFoundry to create a deployable app from your source code and go deploy it on Bluemix! Then, head over to your URL to see it live!
